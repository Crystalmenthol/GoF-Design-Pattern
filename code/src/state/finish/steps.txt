1. Create interface class for state with methos :- insertCoin, ejectCoins, and spin.
2. Create Concrete classes with constructor accept gashapon object for each state (with not implemented Error is just OK right now).
3. Add setState(state: ) for Gashapon (context) class.

4. Now. Start to implement methods for ReadyState class.
    4.1 Add constructor for concrete state classes.
    4.2 Add setCoin(): void method for Gashapon class.
    4.3 Add setCoin(): void
5. Continue to add concrete classes.
6. Implement concrete class method.
7. Change GashaponState type from GashaponMachineState to use interface class (GashaponState).
